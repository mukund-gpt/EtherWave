# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/finalDeploy.js
npx hardhat run scripts/finalDeploy.js --network linea_sepolia
```

```shell
Address of contract : 0x65AFE79Db683f65013D5eC2c407CcBCdb8d6367d
```
